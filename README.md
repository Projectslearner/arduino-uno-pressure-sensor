# Pressure Sensor Analog Reading with Arduino

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to read analog values from a pressure sensor connected to an Arduino board. The analog values correspond to the pressure sensed by the sensor and are displayed on the Serial Monitor for monitoring and analysis.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Pressure Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Pin Connections

- **Pressure Sensor:**
  - **Signal Pin**: Connect to Arduino analog pin A0
  - **VCC**: Connect to Arduino 5V
  - **GND**: Connect to Arduino GND

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the pressure sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the pressure sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the GND pin of the pressure sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino.

2. **Initialize the System:**
   - Start the serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 in the `setup()` function using `Serial.begin(9600);`.

3. **Read Analog Values:**
   - In the `loop()` function, use `analogRead(sensorPin)` to read the analog voltage from the pressure sensor connected to pin A0.
   - Store the analog value in a variable (`sensorValue` in this case) for further processing or analysis.

4. **Output Results:**
   - Print the analog value to the Serial Monitor using `Serial.println(sensorValue)` for real-time monitoring.
   - Introduce a short delay (e.g., 100 milliseconds) between readings to ensure stability and prevent flooding of the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Pressure Sensing:** Use the setup to measure pressure in various applications, such as in pneumatic systems, medical devices, or industrial equipment.
- **Data Logging:** Log pressure readings over time for analysis or troubleshooting purposes.
- **Feedback Control:** Utilize pressure measurements as feedback for control systems to regulate processes or operations.
